# Ical-to-Shedule
Ical-to-Shedules is a **Node-RED-based application** that acts as a converter between Ical url and a Schedule object stored on your **Apex Distech controller**.

You can also use it with [**LoRaBAC**](https://github.com/SylvainMontagny/LoRaBAC) to link your device BACnet objects with the schedule value.
